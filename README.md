# U.S.A Apartments Rental Prediction and Classification with Machine Learning
This project explores the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to predict apartment rental prices in the U.S. based on various features. In addition to regression-based price prediction, the project also includes a classification task that categorizes apartments into three pricing tiers: low, average, and high.

The dataset used is well-researched and has been analyzed by many others. While I drew inspiration from existing analyses (especially from https://www.kaggle.com/code/harleenkaurvt1930/apartment-rent-data-regression-classification/notebook), this project also incorporates novel approaches and more advanced techniquesâ€”most notably, the implementation of Neural Networks for both regression and classification tasks and the use of optimization algorithms.

## Overview of the Project
- Objectives:
  - Perform EDA to find insights about features that affect the rental price of the listings.
  - Filter, and transform the data.
  - Create Pre-processing pipelines to transform the data and make them suitable for machine learning models.
  - Dimensionality Reduction.
  - Feature Engineering.
  - Perform Regression models with the objective to predict the price.
  - Perform Classification models to classify the listings.
  - Optimization of the models.
  - Regression and Error Analysis

- Methodology:
  - Data Preperation
  - Data exploration and preprocessing
  - Regression Analysis
  - Classification Analysis
  - Interpretation and meaningful insights

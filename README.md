U.S. Apartments Rental Prediction and Classification

This project explores the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to predict apartment rental prices in the U.S. based on various features. In addition to regression-based price prediction, the project also includes a classification task that categorizes apartments into three pricing tiers: low, average, and high.

The dataset used is well-researched and has been analyzed by many others. While I drew inspiration from existing analyses, this project also incorporates novel approaches and more advanced techniquesâ€”most notably, the implementation of Neural Networks for both regression and classification tasks.

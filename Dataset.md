This dataset comprises detailed information on apartment rentals, ideal for various machine learning tasks including clustering, classification, and regression. It features a comprehensive set of attributes that capture essential aspects of rental listings, such as:

Identifiers & Location: Includes unique identifiers (id), geographic details (address, cityname, state, latitude, longitude), and the source of the classified listing.
Property Details: Provides information on the apartment's category, title, body, amenities, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and square_feet (size of the apartment).
Pricing Information: Contains multiple features related to pricing, including price (rental price), price_display (displayed price), price_type (price in USD), and fee.
Additional Features: Indicates whether the apartment has a photo (has_photo), whether pets are allowed (pets_allowed), and other relevant details such as currency and time of listing creation.
The dataset is well-cleaned, ensuring that critical columns like price and square_feet are never empty. This makes it a robust resource for developing predictive models and performing in-depth analyses on rental trends and property characteristics.
